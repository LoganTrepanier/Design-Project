    <div class="info"><p>There are two different types of pads in football. Body pads and shoulder pads. Body pads are in the pants and your shirt. Shoulder pands are placed <br>
         on the shoulders and protects your shoulders and rib cage. <br><br>
        Shoulder pads: <br>
 Shoulder pads absorb some of the impact and shock through deformation. The padds are made so when you get hit, the shock <br>
gets distributed through a larger pad that is made to regulate body temperature and prevent injury. <br><br>
 Shoulder pads have a hard plastic outer shell, like a helemt, but it has a soft shock absorbing foam underneath. The pads get secured to your body with straps. <br><br>
Body pads: <br>
For the lower half of your body, integrated football pants are a good way to go. These pants already have lightweight pads <br>
sewed into them to protect the knees, thighs, hips and tailbone. The pads are made of EVA foams that help protect against collisions on the field. <br>
If you  don't have integrated football pants then a girdle also works just as well. There are different types of girdles. Some can have hip pads and tailbone pads <br>
only and others can have all pads. It's like underwear, meaning you put it on and the pants over the girdle. <br><br>
Deoending on the position you play, you might want to invest in extra padding around the ribs or back.  </p></div>
