    <div class="info"><p> Rules are extremely important in any sport. If you don't know the rules than you can't really play the sport. <br>
    Football field: <br>
 A football field is 120 yards long and 53 Â½ yards wide. Each endzone is 10 yards long and they are 100 yards apart from each other. The middle of the field is the 50 yard line. <br>
  Every line on the field represents 5 yards at a time. A small distance from the sidelines are the hash marks. The football is placed on or in betweem <br>
  them on each play. <br>
  The players: <br>
  Each team can have 11 players on the field at a time. Defensive players can place themselves anywhere they want on their side of the ball and they may <br>
  move freely without passing the line of scrimmage. The offensive players on the other hand have to follow some rules that define their positions. 7 players must be <br>
  lined up on the line of scrimmage prior to the snap. The other 4 must be at leats 1 yard behind the line. The players on the line must be set and not move prior to the snap <br>
  but the other 4 can move around in the back field prior to the snap. Only the 4 players in the back may catch or run the ball. <br>
  Game format: <br>
  A football game is divided into 4 quarters. Each quarter is 15 minutes long. After 2 quarters, there is a small break for the players called half-time. <br>
  Time is counted while the plays are running and sometimes in between the plays as well. The time can also stop if certains stuff happens. <br>
  A play: <br>
  The offense tries to move the ball down field on each play by either throwing the ball of running it. The offense gets 4 tries (called downs) to <br>
  get the ball 10 yards. If they get past 10 yards, then they get another 4 downs. That process repeats until they get to the end zone. If they don't <br>
  manage to get 10 yards, then after 4th down, the ball is turned over to the other team. <br>
  The offense can lose possesion of the ball by scoring, interception, not getting 10 yards, fumbling the ball and the other team recovers, punting or kicking the ball <br>
  or getting tackled in their end zone for a safety. <br>
  Penalties: <br>
  Penalties happen when one team breaks a rule. If the defense commits a penalty, than the offense gets to move foward a certain amount of yards for free depending on the <br>
  penalty. If the offense commits the penalty then they have to move back a ceartain amount of yards depending on the penalty. Some penalty examples are false start, offside, <br> pass interference, holding, face mask, intentional grounding, roughing the passer, etc. <br>\
