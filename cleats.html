    <div class="info"><p> Cleats are one of the most important things to have while playing football. They help you get your footing in the turf, they help you run faster on <br> turf and 
    they help you stop and change directions faster than normal shoes. It really doesn;t matter which position you play on the football field, <br> you need cleats to help with traction,
     support and comfort. There are five parts of a cleats. The upper, the outsole, the heel, the midsole and the stud. <br><br>
    The upper: <br>
This part of the cleat helps provide a secure fit using laces or straps, just like a normal shoe. This part of the shoe also features synthetic materials <br> that are designed to withstand 
impact and rough weather conditions. <br><br>
The outsole: <br>
The outsole of the cleat is actually the bottom of the cleat. It is typically made of molded plastic or rubber. The otsole also helps with the stability <br> of the cleat and makes it
to run. <br><br>
The midsole: <br>
The midsole of the cleat give a nice cushion for your foot. The midsole can provide support and impact absorbtion for your foot and the cleat <br> but it depends on the style of the foam used. <br><br>
The heel: <br>
This is an important part of the cleat. It typically has a heel counter on the back of the cleat that helps stop the heel from collapsing. <br><br>
There are also different ypes of cleats like the low-cut cleat, mid-cut cleat and high-cut cleat. <br>
Low-cut cleat: <br>
Low-cut cleats stop before the ankle. Without the top part of the cleat, it allows for maximum maneuverability. These cleats are lightweight and <br>
are typically used by skill positions like receivers, runningbacks and defensive backs. <br>
Mid-cut cleats: <br>
Mid-cut cleats extend to the ankle. These are the best types of cleats to help support the ankle without restricting the movement of the person <br>
 using it. A large variety of players use this type of cleat. <br>
High-cut cleat: <br>
These types of cleats offer the most support as they lace all the way up the ankle. These cleats do boost the support but on the down side, they <br>
do affect the mobility of the user. High-cut cleats are mostly used by linemen.  </p></div>
