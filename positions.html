    <div class="info"><p>A football team is made up of a lot of different positions. lets start with the offence. <br>
    offensive line: <br>
The linemen are the most important position on the offence. Their job is to block for the quarterbacks and running backs. They must protect them at all cost. <br>
It is not as easy as it sounds. The center is the middle of the linemen, he snaps the ball to the quarterback. The left and right guard are right beside him <br>
 and the tackles are beside the guards. <br>
 Tight end: <br>
 A tight end is an extra linemen that blocks but he is also allowed to run down field and catch the ball. <br>
 Wide receiver: <br>
 Wide reveibers mains job is to run, get open and catch the ball when its thrown to them. They line up on or off the line of scrimmage but usually far away from the ball. <br>
 Running backs: <br>
 Their mains jobs are to take hand offs and carry the ball to try and score. They also have to block for the quarterback on pass plays. <br>
 They usually line up behind of beside the quarterback. <br>
 Quarterbacks: <br>
He is the one that gets the ball from the center and runs the play. He is usually a great leader. He needs to be good at giving the ball to the running back and <br> be good at passing the ball. He also needs to be able to read the defense to find the open receiver. <br>
 Now lets talk about the desense <br>
 Defensive line: <br>
 Their job is to get past the O-line to try and tackle the quarterback. The line is made up of a nose guard, D-tackles and D-ends. <br>
 Linebackers: <br>
 The linebackers are the next line of defense behind the D-line. They must stop the runners when the offense runs but they also do <br>
 pass coverage. <br>
 Cornerbacks: <br>
 These are the people that cover the wide receivers amd try to stop them from catching the ball. <br>
 Safety: <br>
 These are the people to prvent the big plays down field. They try to stay the furthest man downfield so if the guy with the ball breaks free, <br>
 they have one last chance to stop him.
