    <div class="info"><p>The helmets are one of the most and if not, it's the most important piece of equipment in football. Helmets are specifically designed to minimize <br> 
        the risk of a head injury during the sport, such as a concussion or bone fractures in the face, etc. Every peice of the helmet is useful and will give your head <br>
         maximum protection against other players. <br><br>
        There are multiple components that make up a helmet. For example, the helmet has an outer shell, it has padding on the inside, a helmet has a face mask and a chin <br>
         strap as well. The next bit will explain the function of each component. <br><br>
        The outer shell: <br>
    The outer shells main function is to defelct the impact on your head. It's made up of a material called polycarbonate alloy. It's a perfect material for the outer <br>
        shell because it's strong, flexible and durable. <br><br>
    Protecting the face: <br>
On the front of every helmet is something called a face mask. It is designed to give as much protection as possible to the face bones and mouth. Your type of face <br>
 mask depends on the position you play. For example, a Quarterback or receiver would traditionally wear a face mask protect the nose and the jaw while giving them a <br>
better field of view. On the other hand, a linemen would wear a face mask that protects the entire face. <br><br>
Padding: <br>
 Padding is there to provide you with extra safety and some comfort. Padding helps absorb the force of the impact to your helmet. The pads are made up of a material <br>
  called thermoplastic polyurethane. It's known for its elasticity and resistance to dirt created by sweat and skin oils. <br><br>
The chin strap: <br>
The chin strap keeps the helmet firmly secured onto someones head. A properly fastened chin strap is tight enough to prevent the helmet from falling off while getting <br>
hit. It makes the helmet 100 times safer.     </p></div>
