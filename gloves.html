    <div class="info"><p> If you watch football, you can see that a lot of them wear gloves. Now those gloves are not just to look cool. They actually help their performance, <br>
    keeping their hands warm and even preventing injury. <br><br>
Wide receiver gloves: <br>
You can see the most common position to wear gloves are wide receivers. Wide receivers like to wear gloves because theu=ir main focus is to catch the ball that is thrown <br> 
their way and wearing gloves will help them a lot. <br><br>
Quaterbacks and their gloves: <br>
You can also sometimes see quarterbacks wearing gloves. Their grip on the ball is one of the fundamental building blocks of their success. If they don't have a proper <br> grip on the ball, their passes can fly off target and even hand offs can be difficult.  </p></div>
