         <div class="aboutme"> <p>Hello customers. You may be curious about the person who made this webiste. What type of audience is the website targeting? In this section, I will be explaining everything so you can <br> get the best understanding possible. To start off, I must thank my design coding teacher ,Mr.Katz, for teach me all of this and allow me to create this website to better help the understanding <br> of football of football
             First of all, there isn't just one reason as to why I made this website. For starters, I really like the sport football. I've been playing the sport since I was five years old. <br> It's always been a pleasure playing the sport but one problem I've encountered with many people I meet is that quite a decent amount of  them don't know the rules, the equiment and many <br> more aspects that make the sport. 
            So once my teacher gave me this project to do, it wasn't like any other project in school. It wasn't boring to create. It gave me this wonderful opportunity <br> to teach people about the sport. <br><br>
        All of that to say I am just a kid who loves football and wants to get more people to understand the sport. I got all of my information through research and from primary research from playing <br> the sport for so long. So this informatiion that i share with you is definitly reliable. <br><br>
    Thank you very much for coming to my webiste and I hope you learn something new :) .    </p></div>
